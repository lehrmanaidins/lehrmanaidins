### Programming: "Hello World!"
I am currently a senior (12th-year). I have taken AP Computer Science A (and got a '5' on the AP test), and I am currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles and Programming I. 
Although, Programming I is not hard at all; it's just basic HTML + CSS (thats if you can evem count those as programming languages) and JavaScript (eww). 
I also have some basic experience using Java, Python, JavaScript, and a teeny-tiny (very small) amount of coding in C++ (1 "Hello World!" Program + some basic arithmetic).
