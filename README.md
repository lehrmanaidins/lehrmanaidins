### Programming: "Hello World!"
I am currently a senior (12th-year). I have taken AP Computer Science A (and got a '5' on the AP test), and I am currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles and Programming I and II. 
I have experience in Java through both AP Computer Science A and Programming II at Mountain View High School. I also am proficient at Python through introductory courses such as AP Computer Science Principles and 
intermediate experience with large data analysis and generation through personal programming progress and various Capture the Flag challenges. 

### CTF's
I have competted in many CTF competitions throughout my high school career. Some of which include my own JROTC's 'BrainChildCTF' (created by David Morgan: [Senior Tech Mentor for US Cyber Games](https://www.uscybergames.com/season-3-coaches))

My Junior year I took Honors Physics in which I exelled so much in my school counselor recomended me to take IB Physics II during my senior year. My end of the year Internal Assesment which I chose the topic was titled
"Determining the Rate of Orbital Decay of a Small Satellite Orbiting in a Circular, Low Earth Orbit." In this paper I applied complicated math equations involving Calculus, Orbital Mechanics, and Atmospheric Drag in Pythoin scripts to generate large 'csv' files containing data on orbital decay rates in m/s. 

### English
I am also in DE English 111/112 through Germana Community College, and have consistiently earned A's. My end of the year Problem-Solution Essay was titled "Assessing the Deficiency of Fully Reusable Launch Vehicles in NASAâ€™s Space Launch Missions."
